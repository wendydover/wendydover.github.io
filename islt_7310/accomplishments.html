<h1>Professional Accomplishments</h1> 
    
    <h3>Library Guides</h3>
    
    <p>Using the SpringShare suite of tools, I have created <a href="https://guides.gulfcoast.edu/prf.php?account_id=478" style="font-size: 14pt">library guides</a> to assist students and faculty to access, evaluate, and utilize library print and online resources as well as other materials found on the open web.</p>
<ul>
    
    <li><a href="https://guides.gulfcoast.edu/sub_healthsciences" style="font-size: 14pt">Health Sciences</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://guides.gulfcoast.edu/sub_science" style="font-size: 14pt">Natural Sciences</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://guides.gulfcoast.edu/sub_publicsafety" style="font-size: 14pt">Public Safety</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Nursing Tutorial</h3>
    
    <p>CINAHL is a discipline specific database and not always intuitive. I created Gulf Coast State College Library tutorials to help nursing students use all the features of this database.</p>

<h3>Designed For-Credit Course</h3>
    <p>Research Skills for College Students is a for-credit course based on the ACRL Framework and provides a step-by-step guide for selecting a topic, formulating a thesis, generating keywords, researching the topic, evaluating resources, and using resources ethically.</p>
