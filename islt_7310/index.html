    <h2> Welcome</h2>
    
    <p>Hi there! I’m Wendy, an Academic Librarian and Instructional Designer and I love to help students get to the information they need.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3> 
    
 <p>I am old enough to remember when all learning was for the average person offline, when distance education was completed through correspondence courses, and young enough to have experienced new digital ways of learning. I am fortunate to have attended college both in person as well as online at a distance. I have a BA in Interdisciplinary Humanities, an MSLIS in Library and Information Science, and as of December 2020, an EdSP in Instructional Technology with an emphasis on Online Design. Currently, I am the Distance Learning and Extended Campus Outreach Librarian for Gulf Coast State College in Panama City, Florida. I’ve done extensive work in the learning management system Canvas, but have also worked with Blackboard, Angel, Moodle, and D2L. I have designed everything from singular assignments to individual modules for course drop in to entire for-credit courses in information literacy.<br><br>
        
     I have been employed as an academic librarian and instructor since 2007.</p>
