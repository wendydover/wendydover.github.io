     Hi! I’m Wendy Dover and I am a librarian at Gulf Coast State College in Panama City, Florida. I’m working on my EdSp and plan to graduate from Mizzou in December. The only web development I’ve done is WYSIWYG creations in Weebly. I’ve created websites for my mom’s 50th high school reunion and a class project last semester. My expectations for the course are simple…I’d really like to know the “behind the scenes” aspects of websites. I remember with my 1st computer… a Commodore 64, I had an instruction booklet with, what I’m guessing were lines of code to be entered in the command prompt that caused all sorts of fun graphics appear on the screen. I’ve been fascinated ever since. 
I hope to use these skills to be able to add lines of code to our library pages and guides, when instructed to “just add a line of CSS.” I hope by the end of the course, I’ll know what that means.  
My hobbies include hanging out with my hubby and our two cats, traveling, and reading.
