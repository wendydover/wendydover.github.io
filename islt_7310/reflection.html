<h1>Philosophical Reflections</h1> 
    <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
    <p class="drop-cap"> My teaching philosophy is rather straightforward – to provide the highest quality instruction that supports not only the successful matriculation of the each student, but the teaching goals of the faculty and the curriculum of the institution. My own role in this drama is that of an academic librarian and instructor at a small state college. Despite my own beliefs, which are somewhat antithetical to the technophobic-leaning perspectives of some in academia, I have nonetheless held this position long enough to recall, with some degree of nostalgic melancholy,  the time when digitization first began to take hold in the library in which I was working. However, it was not with trepidation, that I faced these changes and challenges, but rather, excitement, as I sought to be an agent of positive change in my own acceptance and recognition of this peculiar form of technological, educational and informational “natural selection”.   This did not mean that I would in the words of Dylan Thomas’ “…go quietly into that good night” but rather, that I would as the old adage suggests, “improvise, adapt and overcome.” </p>
    
<p>In so doing, I strive to challenge students to see beyond surface information, encourage them to analyze their findings, and assimilate and synthesize this new information into their own knowledge base. To accomplish this, it is important that all involved in the learning process embrace technology without losing the human touch. In simpler terms it may be said to be a shift away from a strictly bibliographic instructional and librarian centered approach, to one in which the student is more collaboratively linked with not only the library and librarian, but the many disciplines and their faculty, such that information literacy, by way of interdisciplinary interaction and collaboration, becomes not only a way of learning, but a way of life. This fact is all the more relevant in an age in which the dearth of information and information resources available to the student require an even more interdisciplinary and holistic approach to the teaching of not only the often generalized field of information literacy, but also what has become the necessary semiotic and informatic inter-functionality and operability of such things as data and digital literacy. 
    </p>
<p>Teaching and learning are not simple activities, and it’s my job to discover the best methods and practices to help people seek information, evaluate their findings, and use that knowledge responsibly. I research and incorporate the best teaching methods and practices available into my classes so they remain relevant, valuable and interesting. By melding both the established pedagogical methodologies with the growing relevancy of a more andragogical and heutagogical based approach, I provide a holistic atmosphere that incorporates the tried and true methods of bibliographic instruction as well as new technologies to create a fun, authentic, enriching, interactive, and effective learning experience in an integrated and inter-operative learning environment. While I teach traditional searching using, among other concepts, Boolean phrases, truncation, phrase searching, and scholarly vs. popular, I also incorporate video tutorials, games, and laughter into my instruction sessions. I also keep in mind the particular needs of both students and faculty and the standards as set forth by the Association of College and Research Libraries Information Literacy (ACRL-IL) into all my instruction sessions and assess what I have taught at the end of each session.  This results in an enjoyable interaction for all participants, and it’s been my experience that enjoyable authentic experiences are those best remembered.  At the end of each session I make sure the students and faculty know that I am available for individual consultations should they need further assistance. 
    </p> 
<p>What I'm suggesting, is that information literacy in the 21st century is, and should remain, as much about personal self-efficacy and effective interpersonal communication and collaboration as it is computer, digital and/or technological self-efficacy and the interface between the student and the information resources and concomitant technology. For while allowing for more and easier access to information, technology does not, by itself, provide the student with the ability to discriminate between what may well be good or bad information or impart knowledge and wisdom, nor does it allay the confusion that arises when old world students and faculty are forced to come to terms with new world ways of learning. What I have come to realize was something that deep down, I knew all along, and that is, for better or worse, the threat of change and change itself are never going to be adequately addressed by the gnashing of teeth or the wringing of hands. My own experiences have instilled in me a firm belief that I must be part of the solution to the problems of the information age and to help facilitate the promises of the digital age, on the front lines of the fight for informational and educational enlightenment.  I believe it is in the role of an Information Literacy Librarian that I might best facilitate the successful bridging of the best of both worlds.
