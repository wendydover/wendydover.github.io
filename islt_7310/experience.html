             <h1>Librarian, Distance Learning and Extended Campus Outreach</h1> 
        <p>I've been the librarian for Distance Learning and Extended Campus Outreach for Gulf Coast State College since 2015. In this position, I </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Plan, implement, and evaluate library services for the Distance Learning Community</li>
                <li>Coordinate, monitor, promote, and evaluate virtual services, including Embedded Librarians and Online Chat and FAQ service</li>
                <li>Ensure and demonstrate that library services meet or exceed the Fundamental Library Requirements delineated in the Association of College and Research Libraries Standards for Distance Learning Library Services</li>
                <li>Ensure and demonstrate that library services meet or exceed the Professional Competencies for Health Sciences Librarians as defined by the Medical Library Association. </li>
            </ul>
        <p>As a Distance Learning Librarian and Instructor, I go where the students and faculty are. This is true, whether I teach in a physical classroom or as an embedded librarian online in a virtual class. I ensure that access to library materials and services for facutly, staff and students is equivalant whether on our main Panama City campus, our extended campuses of North Bay, Gulf Franklin, and Tyndall AFB, distance learning faculty and students, or enrolled in high-school dual enrollment classes. In this position, I put into practice the idea that an academic library's resources and services are not confined by or limited to a patron's physical location. </p>

        <h1>Designer and Instructor, LIS2004 Research Skills for College Students</h1> 
        <p>As part of a statewide team, I helped design, inplement, and teach LIS 2004.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In 2016 The Council on Instructional Affairs Learning Resources Standing Committee for the State of Florida charged the LIS 2004 Curriculum Revision Committee to revise and replace the existing LIS 2004 curriculum with totally new content reflective of current pedagogy and the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education. The new committee will replace all of the LIS statewide curriculum committees.</li>
                <li>Created a Health Sciences version of the course in 2019 for students entering Health Sciences Program</li>
                <li><img style="border: 0pt none; float:inherit; padding-right: 10px; padding-bottom: 10px;" src="images/LIS%20for%20health%20sciences.jpg" alt="course design image" height="500">  
</li>
                
                
            </ul>
   <p>My teaching and design philosophy is simple – provide the highest quality instruction that supports the students and the curriculum of the institution.  I strive to challenge students to see beyond surface information, encourage them to analyze their findings, and assimilate and synthesize this new information into their own knowledge base.  
I provide a holistic atmosphere that incorporates the tried and true methods of bibliographic instruction as well as new technologies to create a fun, enriching, and effective learning experience.  While I teach traditional searching using, among other concepts, Boolean phrases, truncation, phrase searching, and scholarly vs. popular, I also incorporate video tutorials, games, and laughter into my instruction sessions.  This results in an enjoyable interaction for all participants and it’s been my experience that enjoyable experiences are those best remembered.  At the end of each session I make sure the students know that I am available for individual consultations should they need further assistance.

        <h1>Librarian, Access Services</h1> 
        <p>From 2010 to 2015, I was the Access Services Librarian for Gulf Coast State College. As the Access Services Librarian, I </p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Supervised circulation activities</li> 
                <li>Ran circulation, reserves, and interlibrary loan reports through the library management system, Aleph</li>
                <li>FTP file loads for employees and students into LMS</li>
                <li>Pulled, processed, shipped, and received interlibrary loans</li>
                <li>Supervised library student employees</li>
   
        </ul>
        <p>As the Access Services Librarian, I handled all aspects of Circulation, Inter-Library Loan, and supervised one full time employee and between six and ten student employees per semester. I was liaison to the Social Science Division where I taught Information Literacy classes that incorporate ACRL IL Standards specific to the course, recommended library materials for purchase, and worked one on one with faculty creating tutorials and subject and course guides. I maintained the library’s Facebook page, regularly posting events, reminders, and other information. <br> <br>

My commitment to library services extends beyond the walls of my current institution. During this time, I served on the state-wide Cooperation and Development Standing Committee and the Access Services Standing Committee. In this capacity, I promoted the integration and enhancement of library services, advocated for cooperative resource sharing, and insured patron privacy throughout the 28 community and state colleges in Florida. </p>
